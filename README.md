I used XAMPP and MAMP for this project.
For the email verification function please use XAMPP. For everything else, use MAMP.

I am yet to utilize the whole project on XAMPP for future versions of this project after I fixed some bugs.
Until then, please use MAMP but please be reminded that the file "registration.php" won't work as it was coded specifically to work with XAMPP.

Please be reminded that I used the default/standard MySQL authentication on both MySQL workbench and PHPMyAdmin.
I never used MySQL SHA authentication on this project.
